# staRs
This report outlines a simulation study run on the “stars” data set that aims to explore whether a relationship exists between the magnitude and the temperature of a star. Data are simulated according to the properties of the observed values for temperature and following a linear regression model for magnitude to produce data that can help answer the question of whether a relationship exists between the two properties. The simulation scenarios that are explored consider different effect sizes between magnitude and temperature, different sample sizes of the data sets, and measurement errors in recording the values. Parametric t-tests and a non-parametric randomisation test is run on the simulated data sets, and from these, it is found that the ability to correctly identify the presence or absence of a relationship weakens with lower effect and sample sizes than the effect size and sample size in the observed data.
